# About :pushpin:

`get_next_line` is a [42 Common Core](https://github.com/PedroZappa/42_CommonCore) project that delves into how `static variables` and `file descriptors` work. It is a challenge on `memory allocation`. It returns the contents of a line per function call from a given `fd`, until the end of the file is reached. `get_next_line` must be implemented so that it handles any `BUFFER_SIZE` defined at compile time. The bonus challenge is simple: the implementation must be able to handle multiple file descriptors at any time. Each function call should be able to read from different `fd`s without loosing track of partial lines read into its `static` buffer. 

---

# Usage :checkered_flag:

Two distinct implementation can be found in this repository: the one on `srcll` implements `Linked Lists` without the bonus; while the other on `srcb` uses `Arrays` and meets the bonus requirements.
