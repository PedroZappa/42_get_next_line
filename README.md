# About :pushpin:

`get_next_line` is a [42 Common Core](https://github.com/PedroZappa/42_CommonCore) project that delves into how `static variables` and `file descriptors` work. It is a challenge on `memory allocation`. 


---

# Usage :checkered_flag:

0. Clone repository & enter directory:

```sh
	git clone https://github.com/PedroZappa/get_next_line.git zedro-gnl
	cd zedro-gnl
```

Two distinct implementation can be found in this repository: the one on `srcll` implements `Linked Lists` without the bonus; while the other on `srcb` uses `Arrays` and meets both mandatory and bonus requirements. 

___

1. Compile mandatory `get_next_line` with `Arrays` ðŸ—‚:

```sh
make
```

2. Compile bonus `get_next_line` with `Arrays` ðŸ—‚:

```sh
make bonus
```

3. Compile mandatory `get_next_line` with `Linked Lists` ðŸ”—:

```sh
make extrall
```

___

# Implementation :scroll:

## Mandatory 

`get_next_line` must:
- Return the contents of a line per function call read from a given `file descriptor`, until the end of the file is reached. 
- it must be implemented so that it handles any `BUFFER_SIZE` defined at compile time. 

## Bonus

- Must use only one `static` variable.
- The function must be able to handle multiple file descriptors appropriately.
- Each function call should be able to read from different `fd` without loosing track of partial lines read into its `static` buffer.
